# 1. TRANS (Taiwan Real-time Ambient Noise System)
### TRANS is a real-time system to monitor ambient noise data with 40 seismic staions across Taiwan. Aims to analyze and quantify Taiwanâ€™s ambient noise characteristics to monitor corresponding meteorological events, tectonic activities, and anthropogenic activities. This project uses front-end and back-end separate development. The front-end is for web page display and data visualization. It is mainly implemented using `React.js` and receives real-time data from the back-end. The back-end is divided into data pre-processing, data scientific calculation, and real-time data transmission of front-end and back-end. Mainly using `Python` to process seismic data and `Flask` as a lightweight back-end.

# 2. Backend
## Data pre-processing and science
### This part of the code has not been released to the public because it is confidential. It mainly uses the python library `seedlink` to receive the seismic real-time raw waveform, and uses `obspy` for waveform pre-processing (including bandpass filtering, resample, taper, etc.). Further estimates the ellipticity, polarization degree and Azimuth. And through data analysis, rose diagrams, source maps and seismic velocity changes are produced.
## Sending processed real-time data
###  In `./api` folder, `api.py` will package the real-time azimuth diagrams obtained by data analysis into a json file and send it to the front-end with `socketio`, updating every 5 minutes.
```
$ python api/api.py
```

# 3. Front-end
### The web development is built up by React.js. I use `react-bootstrap` to construct the grid system of the web. There are also some techniques help me to complete it (./src/components):
* App.js: The `socket` module can realize real-time data transmission. The `mapboxgl` is a map tool to show Taiwan's map with all the seismic stations with historical data and source map every hour.
* Source.js: The component is used to define source maps with different frequency ranges by clicking buttons.
* Legend.js: The component builds up the legend of source map density and H/V ratios.
```
In ./ folder:
$ npm start
```
